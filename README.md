# spring-break-itinerary

The Odin Project practice project, but instead of 'Recipes', I'll map out a little itinerary for my 10-day break from work. 

My vacation starts on April 15 and ends on April 25. 

Unfortunately, I will not be traveling. However, I will be making local plans. This includes catching up with friends, connecting with nature, and visiting fun places. 

(I mainly want to connect with nature, tbh)
